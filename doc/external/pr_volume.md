Quality Assurance : PR Volume
=============================

The PR Volume chart shows you information about [Quality](http://focusedobjective.com/team-metrics-right/) – "how well" your team is using pull requests to deliver value to your customers.

What does it show?

PR Volume appears only when viewing your work on pull requests

PR Volume compares the volume (lines added or deleted) of pull requests that are successfully completed (merged) with the volume of pull requests that are ultimately rejected (closed without merging).

What do the numbers mean?
-------------------------

**Merged Volume**

*   For each week, the total volume (lines added or deleted) of PRs that were open during that week but eventually merged.

**Rejected Volume**

*   For each week, the total volume (lines added or deleted) of PRs that were open during that week but eventually rejected.

What does this tell me about my team performance?
-------------------------------------------------

Is there a big increase in the volume of rejected PRs?

*   Rejected PRs represent wasted effort. Consider changes you could make to ensure that development is on the right track before the PR is created.
*   When large PRs are rejected, the waste may be a significant drag on team performance. Consider changes you could make to ensure that unneeded PRs are recognized quickly before they become large.

Are there big fluctuations in the total volume of merged PRs?

*   Are PR lead times increasing? Maybe you are taking on too much change in each PR. Consider how you could organize changes into smaller PRs that are easier to review.
*   Are JIRA issue lead times increasing? Maybe you are dealing with ill\-defined work items that keep piling up PRs as the intended results change. Consider how you could clarify intended results before PRs begin.

Does a high volume of rejected PRs persist for several weeks?

*   Maybe unneeded PRs are not getting enough attention and are lingering in a "walking dead" state. Consider changes you could make to ensure that PR reviews are completed more quickly.
